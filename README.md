# Users

If a `$current_user` is present, we use their email as an identifier in the widget.
Otherwise the widget operates in [anonymous mode](https://app.quantimo.do/live-chat) and you can require that a user submit their email address. This allows you to talk with anonymous visitors on your WordPress site.
