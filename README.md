# QuantiModo WordPress Integration

Help ignite a revolution of citizen science to find new solutions to chronic illnesses.  Install the Quantimodo WordPress plugin!

This plugin allows your users to record, aggregate, analyze and visualize their health and life-tracking data.
The data collection, analysis and visualization functionality may be included in any page or post.

# Installation

1. Create, configure, and optionally add your branding to your new app at [QuantiModo](https://app.quantimodo.com/builder).  It's free!
2. Add this plugin to WordPress and enable it. See [Managing Plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins)

4. Visit QuantiModo Settings on your WordPress site (yoursite.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=menus.php), enter your app's QuantiModo client id and save.

Go to your user-facing site, refresh the page and click the icon in the lower right corner to try out your new app!

# Users

If the user is logged in on your WordPress site, we use their WordPress id as an identifier in the widget.
Otherwise the widget operates in anonymous mode and the user must log in with a social provider or QuantiModo account.
